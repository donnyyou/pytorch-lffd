# A Light and Fast Face Detector for Edge Devices
**This repo is updated frequently, keeping up with the latest code is highly recommended.**

## Recent Update
* `2019.07.25` This repos is first online. Face detection code and trained models are released.
* `2019.08.15` This repos is formally released. Any advice and error reports are sincerely welcome.
* `2019.08.22` face_detection: latency evaluation on TX2 is added.
* `2019.08.25` face_detection: RetinaFace-MobileNet-0.25 is added for comparison (both accuracy and latency).
* `2019.09.09` LFFD is ported to NCNN ([link](https://github.com/SyGoing/LFFD-with-ncnn)) and MNN ([link](https://github.com/SyGoing/LFFD-MNN)) by [SyGoing](https://github.com/SyGoing), great thanks to SyGoing.
* `2019.09.10` face_detection: **important bug fix:** vibration offset should be subtracted by shift in data iterator. This bug may result in lower accuracy, inaccurate bbox prediction and bbox vibration in test phase.
We will upgrade v1 and v2 as soon as possible (should have higher accuracy and more stable).

## Introduction
This repo releases the source code of paper "[LFFD: A Light and Fast Face Detector for Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10633)". Our paper presents a light and fast face detector (**LFFD**) for edge devices.
LFFD considerably balances both accuracy and latency, resulting in small model size, fast inference speed while achieving excellent accuracy.
**Understanding the essence of receptive field makes detection networks interpretable.**
  
In practical, we have deployed it in cloud and edge devices (like NVIDIA Jetson series and ARM-based embedding system). The comprehensive performance
of LFFD is robust enough to support our applications.

In fact, our method is **_a general detection framework that applicable to one class detection_**, such as face detection, pedestrian detection, 
head detection, vehicle detection and so on. In general, an object class, whose average ratio of the longer side and the shorter side is 
less than 5, is appropriate to apply our framework for detection.

Several practical advantages:
1. large scale coverage, and easy to extend to larger scales by adding more layers without much latency gain.
2. detect small objects (as small as 10 pixels) in images with extremely large resolution (8K or even larger) in only one inference.
3. easy backbone with very common operators makes it easy to deploy anywhere.

## Accuracy and Latency
We train LFFD on train set of WIDER FACE benchmark. All methods are evaluated on val/test sets under the SIO schema (please
refer to the paper for details).

In the paper, three hardware platforms are used for latency evaluation: NVIDIA GTX TITAN Xp, NVIDIA TX2 and 
Rasberry Pi 3 Model B+ (ARM A53). 

We report the latency of inference only (for NVIDIA hardwares, data transfer is included), excluding
pre-processing and post-processing. The batchsize is set to 1 for all evaluations.

> On NVIDIA platform, TensorRT is the best choice for inference. So we conduct additional latency evaluations using TensorRT 
(**the latency is dramatically decreased!!!**). 
As for ARM based platform, we plan to use [MNN](https://github.com/alibaba/MNN) and [Tengine](https://github.com/OAID/Tengine) 
for latency evaluation. Details can be found in the sub-project [face_detection](face_detection/README.md).

## Getting Started
We implement the proposed method using MXNet Module API.

#### Prerequirements (global)
* Python>=3.5
* numpy>=1.16 (lower versions should work as well, but not tested)
* MXNet>=1.4.1 ([install guide](http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/versions/master/install/index.html?platform=Linux&language=Python&processor=GPU))
* cv2=3.x (pip3 install opencv-python==3.4.5.20, other version should work as well, but not tested)

> Tips: 
  * use MXNet with cudnn.
  * build numpy from source with OpenBLAS. This will improve the training efficiency.
  * make sure cv2 links to libjpeg-turbo, not libjpeg. This will improve the jpeg decode efficiency.
